# VIP-Membership-System
The aim of the project was to develop a VIP Membership System for an SMB retailer, utilising fully-automated business process models in order to demonstrate the logic of the following business processes within the organisation:

1. How a customer can become a VIP member
2. How will VIP membership be used within orders
3. How customers can cancel their VIP membership

The developer team consisted of 3 individuals, Callum Jones, Connor Mackintosh and Jeno Labodi, who completed the project deliverables in Agile settings, dividing the project into fortnight-long sprints as well as utilising Gitlab for version control and Jira for tracking product development. 

The VIP Membership System is based on;
* 3 BPMN 2.0 operational models designed with Camunda 7.18
* Camunda Forms
* Java 15
* Spring Boot 2.7.3
* H2 Database

## Project Description

The initial aim of the project was to evaluate the current architecture of the client's information system and propose changes in order to implement the VIP Membership System. The proposal consisted of developing a socio-technical model of the business using i* framework and delivering 3 conceptual-level BPMN 2.0 diagrams that represent the required business processes. Delivering the conceptual models followed by extending the developed business process models to operation-level diagrams that provided the basis of the delivered VIP-Membership-System.
